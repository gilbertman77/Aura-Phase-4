Aura Phase 4

Existing Material
Engineers at project Aura attempted to create a demo software program but had problems finishing.  They decided to contract out
the software portion and focus on building the hardware for the chair.   The engineers began their project using code found on 
Github, and then attempted to modify it to suit their needs. 

    Below is the original Github source code they modified.

During the modification, the engineers broke the code and after spending too much time and money fixing the issue, the project 
manager ceased software development and as note above, subcontracted out completion of the software portion.

    Below is the non-functional code and files:

        game_broken.py
            /images
            /sounds


Additionally, your company has hired a hardware specialist with basic programming knowledge.  She was able to get a few of the Crickit HAT functions working, while also using the breadboard.   Unfortunately, she had a family emergency and took a leave of absence from the company.  The Python code she generated to control the inputs and output is available.  However, the wiring of her project was not documented, there are only pictures available that were taken as she progressed.
The code below is known to work when all the proper libraries are installed.   Specifically, the crickit library, and the Adafruit_DHT library (if using)

    Below is the Crickit HAT and Breadboard code generated:

Tutorial Used to Use DHT11 Sensor
    Below is a link to the tutorial the engineer used to integrate the temperature sensor.   However, it is known that the library 
    is outdated, but functional.
